            The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the
            worldâ€™s biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their
            status, it is a powerful tool to inform and catalyse action for
            biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting
            the natural resources we need to survive. It provides information
            about range, population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade,
            threats, and conservation actions that will help inform necessary
            conservation decisions.

            The most important thing that can be done by environmental awareness
            is to educate the people about the consequences of the continuation
            of human activities which is affecting the health of the
            environment.
